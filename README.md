# Latent Program Synthesis and Reflective Symbolic Execution: A Modular Architecture for TrustworthyReasoning in Language Models

I present a novel architecture that augments large language models (LLMs) with latent program synthesis and symbolic reasoning via an executable domainspecific language (DSL), embedded in a closed feedback loop. Our system
integrates a latent program generator, a symbolic execution engine, and a reflective self-repair mechanism into a modular cognitive pipeline. This architecture
enables real-time verifiable reasoning, interpretability, and reduced token inefficiency, while outperforming LLM baselines on logical tasks. We formalize the
interaction dynamics with probabilistic convergence guarantees and show that our approach scales symbolic reasoning efficiently with limited parameter budgets.
The system offers a new direction for modular, explainable, and autonomous LLMs capable of planning, memory integration, and multi-agent reasoning.

# *Symbolic Reasoning Execution Workflow**
This benchmark evaluates the symbolic reasoning system on 8 classic algorithmic tasks. Each task is executed through a latent program synthesis pipeline, with automatic
DSL generation and symbolic execution. The accompanying Jupyter notebook included in this repository provides the implementation and experiments corresponding to this paper.
